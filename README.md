# Autodb

A very simple automated single table read-write Active Record Pattern implementation.

LIMITATIONS TO BE AWARE OF BEFORE YOU WOULD USE:

    This is not ORM. Just an active record pattern, it doesn't support joins on purpose.
    One AutoRecord instance = one row in one database's one table
    One AutoDb instance <-> One SQL database connection
    Static saveMore() and deleteMore() methods will only run on same AutoDb, same mysqli, same table rows, otherwise throwing AutoDbException. (Empty array won't throw)
    Also save(), row(), rowsArray(), newRow(), saveMore() and deleteMore() are final for a reason
    Recommended usage - AutoRecord(s) as class member (composition), AutoDb (one per connection instance) as singleton or in any container globally available
    One Database, one Table two calls for Primary key -> use the same AutoDb instance and you will never have a duplicated AutoRecord instance
    Redis is an optional dependency for caching table describes.
    If using more AutoDb (more tables or more connections) with Redis table definition caching, you WANT to set different $ident for AutoDb::init()
    If using Redis cache you WANT to purge 'autodbdefs.*' redis keys in your deploy script, or at least you REALLY WANT TO delete it right after running an ALTER TABLE
    Everything by AutoDb or AutoRecord will throw a new instance of AutoDbException in all circumstances
    For now, supports only MySQL - with mysqli (PDO planned to be supported very soon)
    For now, supports only databases with auto_increment positive integer primary keys (planned to work with unique keys too)
    For now, we do not support editing of primary keys, but you should do that manually and carefully anyway
    For now, type checking is very basic, will improve
    For now, no concurrent writing (INSERT IGNORE INTO, REPLACE INTO), this is the NEXT feature to be implemented

Usage example:

```php
    <?php
    // create a new AutoDb instance connecting to your database connection. One mysqli resource <-> One AutoDb
    $autoDb = AutoDb::init($mysqli, $optionalRedis); 
    // $mysqli is instanceof mysqli right after you connected
    // one $autoDb per connection is recommended, solve it with your own conatainer/singleton for best results
    
    //new record
    $rec = $autoDb->newRow('my_table'); // loads table definition once in runtime with describe 
    $rec->attr('some_column', 'newvalue');
    $rec->save();
    echo $rec->attr('my_table_id'); // gives you back the column value
    
    //existing record
    $rec = $autoDb->row('my_table', 'my_table_id', 23); // returns row with primary key my_table_id 23
    $rec->attr('some_column', 'changed_value');
    $rec->save();
    
    // for array of AutoRecord instances with one single query (and returns object cache version if exists)
    $arrayRecords = $autoDb->rowsArray($table, $where, $limit, $page); // limit default is -1 (unlimited results), page defaults to 1
    // BEWARE - 2nd parameter here is just an UNESCAPED string
    
    // You may also get a previous but unsaved value of an attr you already saved:
    echo $x->attr('username'); // 'changedPreviously'
    $x->attr('username', 'changedAgain');
    echo $x->attr('username'); // 'changedAgain'
    echo $x->dbAttr('username'); // 'changedPreviously' - from instance
    echo $x->dbAttrForce('username'); // 'changedPreviously' - from database
    $x->save(); // now all will be 'changedAgain'
    
    // AutoDb also supports Read only, Write once and blocked tables:
    $autoDb->addBannedTable('sensitive_table');
    $autoDb->addWriteOnceTable('my_strict_log');
    $autoDb->addReadOnlyTable('categories');
    
    // You can insert more new rows with one single query optimally using 
    AutoRecord::saveMore($arrayOfSameTableAutorecords);
    // This line will also update one by one the lines already having a primary key
    
    // You can also delete in one single query multiple lines
    AutoRecord::deleteMore($arrayOfSameTableAutorecords);
```

```
    <?php
    // to run unit tests add to project root a file test_mysql_connection_credentials.php as stated in tests/bootstrap.php:
    
    // GITIGNORED FILE:
    <?php
    
    define('MYSQL_HOST', 'localhost');
    define('MYSQL_USER', 'youruser');
    define('MYSQL_PASSWORD', 'yourpassword');
    
```
